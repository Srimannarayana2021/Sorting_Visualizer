# Sorting Visualizer
## overview

This project is built to explore and understand the Document Object Model (DOM).
The visualizer allows users to interactively visualize various sorting algorithms to gain insights into how they work.

# Features
Interactive Visualization: See the sorting algorithms in action with a visual representation of the sorting process.
Algorithm Selection      : Choose from a variety of sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
Adjustable Speed         : Control the speed of the sorting animation to observe the algorithm's behavior in real-time.
Array Size Customization : Experiment with different array sizes to observe how the algorithms perform on varying inputs.

# Sorting Algorithms Included
